Place to put todo work and general thoughts:

1) Refactor memory to be split into sections based of memory map. This will
   allow for pointer manipulation during bank switching and make mirroring
   easier.

2) nestest log at http://www.qmtpro.com/~nes/misc/nestest.log seems to multiply
   their cycle count by 3 relative to mine. I think there is going to be some
   component that runs at a lower frequency, 1/3 to be exact, of the CPU (PPU
   maybe?). In this case multiplying by 3 would let us work with whole numbers
   in cycle counting.
